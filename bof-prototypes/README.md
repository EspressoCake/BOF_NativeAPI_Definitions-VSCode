## bof-prototypes

Serves as a series of `VSCode` snippets in which:
- NT/ZW functions prototypes are handled via `bp_` prefixed strings
- NT/ZW functions implementations are handled via `bf_` prefixed strings
  - All implementations have sane default values to assist development

Usage:
- Use the precompiled release package
- Add the extension using the "Install from VSIX" option within the `VSCode` extensions menu
